# 📖 Welcome to Usher Documentation repository

Welcome to the Usher documentation repository! Here, our goal is to help our users unleash the full potential of Usher,
allowing them to effectively manage and grow their partner networks, streamline referral programs, and seamlessly
integrate Usher into their Web2 and Web3 projects.

For more information about the Usher project, its source code, and technical details, please visit the [Usher Organization Profile](https://github.com/usherlabs). You will find the Usher Core, Usher.js, and Usher
Programs components repositories, along with instructions on how to set up and deploy your instance of Usher.

This website is built using **[Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/)**, a modern static website generator designed to
make it easy for developers to create and maintain documentation sites.

# Get started

## Installation

```sh
$ pnpm install

```

## Local Development

```sh
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without
having to restart the server.

# Customization

## Creating and organizing content

- Store content in the **`docs`** directory, supporting **`.md`** and **`.mdx`**
  files. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc)
- Configure each folder metadata accordingly, using`_category_.json`
  or`_category_.yml`. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#category-item-metadata)
- Utilize frontmatter options for configuration and
  customization. [See the API here →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter)
- Set a specific page as the main page [link] (if you do not intend to create a dedicated homepage. Otherwise, to create
  a homepage learn more here)
- Configure header navigation items in the **`docusaurus.config.js`**
  file. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-multi-instance#docs-navbar-items)
- Create multiple sidebars by updating **`sidebars.js`** according to your docs folder
  structure. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/multiple-sidebars)

**Example of a tree structure in the `docs` folder:**

```
docs
├── getting-started
│   ├── introduction.md
│   └── installation.md
└── guides
    ├── configuration.md
    └── customization.md

```

**Using the autogenerated sidebar:**

```js
module.exports = {
	sidebars: {
		gettingStarted: [
			{
				type: "autogenerated",
				dirName: "getting-started"
			}
		],
		guides: [
			{
				type: "autogenerated",
				dirName: "guides"
			}
		]
	}
};
```

This will generate separate sidebars for the **`getting-started`** and **`guides`** folders. Adjust the header
navigation items in **`docusaurus.config.js`** accordingly.

Ensure you update both the **`sidebars.js`** file and the header navigation items in **`docusaurus.config.js`** when
changing the documentation structure, providing a seamless navigation experience for users.

## Customization

### Basic customization

- Change fonts following instructions at `tailwind.config.ts`
- Modify typography settings at `tailwind.config.ts`
- Update colors at `tailwind.config.ts`

### Advanced customization

- Apply component-specific styles at specific `module.css` files
- Use mdx and React. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react)
- Swizzle built-in components or update our modifications at `src/theme/*`
  files. [Learn more about Swizzling →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling)
- Develop custom React pages at `src/pages`. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages#add-a-react-page)

# Best practices

- When swizzling components, add comments to indicate where changes occurred
- Follow Docusaurus-specific best practices for versioning and
  customization. [Learn more →](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning#recommended-practices)

# Deployment

## Build

```sh
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the **`build`** directory and can be served using any static contents hosting
service.

## Documentation deployment guidelines

e.g.:

To deploy your documentation with Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you don't have one.
2. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download)** by running **`npm i -g vercel`\*\*.
3. Run **`vercel login`** in your terminal and log in using your Vercel account.
4. In your project directory, run **`vercel`** to initiate the deployment process. Follow the prompts to link your
   project to Vercel.
5. Once your project is linked, Vercel will deploy your documentation. After the deployment, you'll receive a URL to
   access your live documentation.

For subsequent deployments, run **`vercel --prod`** in your project directory to deploy your documentation to the
production environment.

For more information on Vercel deployments, consult the [official Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).
